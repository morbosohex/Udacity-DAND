Probability Quiz
In this quiz, you will simulate coin flips and die rolls to compute proportions for the following outcomes.

Two fair coin flips produce exactly two heads
Three fair coin flips produce exactly one head
Three biased coin flips with P(H) = 0.6 produce exactly one head
A die rolls an even number
Two dice roll a double
Then, you'll compare these proportions with probabilities in the quizzes below.

When simulating coin flips, use 0 to represent heads and 1 to represent tails. When simulating die rolls, use the correct integers to match the numbers on the sides of a standard 6 sided die.

Also, notice that you can look at the solutions if you get stuck by clicking the orange button in the top left.
