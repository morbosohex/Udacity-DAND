Conditional Probability & Bayes Rule Quiz
In the previous section, you found the following proportions from the cancer results dataset.

Patients with cancer: 0.105
Patients without cancer: 0.895
Patients with cancer who tested positive: 0.905
Patients with cancer who tested negative: 0.095
Patients without cancer who tested positive: 0.204
Patients without cancer who tested negative: 0.796
Based on the above proportions observed in the data, we can assume the following probabilities.

Probability	Meaning
P(cancer) = 0.105	Probability a patient has cancer
P(~cancer) = 0.895	Probability a patient does not have cancer
P(positive|cancer) = 0.905	Probability a patient with cancer tests positive
P(negative|cancer) = 0.095	Probability a patient with cancer tests negative
P(positive|~cancer) = 0.204	Probability a patient without cancer tests positive
P(negative|~cancer) = 0.796	Probability a patient without cancer tests negative
Quiz Questions
Use the probabilities given above and Bayes rule to compute the following probabilities.

Probability a patient who tested positive has cancer, or P(cancer|positive)
Probability a patient who tested positive doesn't have cancer, or P(~cancer|positive)
Probability a patient who tested negative has cancer, or P(cancer|negative)
Probability a patient who tested negative doesn't have cancer, or P(~cancer|negative)
Then, use the Jupyter notebook to compare them to true proportions in the dataset.
