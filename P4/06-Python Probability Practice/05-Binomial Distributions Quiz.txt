Binomial Distributions Quiz
In this quiz, you will simulate coin flips using np.random.binomial compute proportions for the following outcomes.

A fair coin flip produces heads
Five fair coin flips produce exactly one head
Ten fair coin flips produce exactly four heads
Five biased coin flips with P(H) = 0.8 produce exactly five heads
Ten biased coin flips with P(H) = 0.15 produce exactly three heads
Then, you'll compare these proportions with probabilities in the quizzes below.
